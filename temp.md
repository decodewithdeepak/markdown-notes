## **1. Introduction to Management**

### 1.1 Meaning of Management

> PYQ: Objective of management (Jul-21, 3 marks)  
> PYQ: "Management is a continuous process." (Jul-22, 2.5 marks)

**Management** is the process of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling the efforts of organizational members and using all available organizational resources to achieve stated organizational goals efficiently and effectively. It involves coordinating and overseeing the work activities of others so that their activities are completed efficiently and effectively.

In simple terms, management means getting things done through people. It is about making decisions, allocating resources, and directing the activities of others to attain goals. Management is present in every organization, whether it is a business, hospital, school, or government office.

**Key Points:**
- Management is goal-oriented
- Management is a continuous process
- Management involves decision-making
- Management works through people
- Management is universal (needed everywhere)

### 1.2 Definitions of Management

> PYQ: Derive the terms 'Management'. (Jul-21, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: Define Management. Also explain the characteristics and principles of Management. (Jul-22, 15 marks)

Different management experts have defined management in various ways:

**According to Henri Fayol:** "To manage is to forecast and plan, to organize, to command, to coordinate and to control."

**According to F.W. Taylor:** "Management is the art of knowing what you want to do and then seeing that it is done in the best and cheapest way."

**According to Harold Koontz:** "Management is the art of getting things done through and with people in formally organized groups."

**According to Peter Drucker:** "Management is a multipurpose organ that manages business and manages managers and manages workers and work."

**Simple Definition:** Management is the process of working with and through people to achieve organizational objectives by making efficient use of limited resources in a changing environment.

### 1.3 Characteristics of Management

> PYQ: Define Management. Also explain the characteristics and principles of Management. (Jul-22, 15 marks)

**1. Goal-Oriented Process:**
- Management always aims to achieve specific organizational goals
- All management activities are directed towards accomplishing predetermined objectives
- Without goals, management has no direction

**2. Universal Application:**
- Management is needed in all types of organizations (business, government, hospitals, schools)
- Management principles apply everywhere, regardless of size or nature of organization
- Every organization needs planning, organizing, and controlling

**3. Continuous Process:**
- Management is an ongoing activity
- It does not end with accomplishing one goal
- Managers must continuously plan, organize, direct, and control

**4. Multi-dimensional:**
- **Management of Work**: Deciding what work needs to be done
- **Management of People**: Ensuring people work efficiently
- **Management of Operations**: Coordinating all activities

**5. Group Activity:**
- Management involves working with groups of people
- Individual efforts are coordinated to achieve common goals
- Teamwork is essential

**6. Dynamic Function:**
- Management must adapt to changing environment
- Techniques and approaches change with time
- Flexibility is important

**7. Intangible Force:**
- Management cannot be seen or touched
- Its presence is felt through results (orderliness, efficiency, goal achievement)
- Effects are visible, but management itself is invisible

**8. Composite Process:**
- Management involves multiple functions (planning, organizing, staffing, directing, controlling)
- All functions are interrelated and interdependent
- Success requires coordination of all functions

---

## **2. Management vs Administration**

> PYQ: Differentiate between Management and Administration. (Jul-22, 2.5 marks)

### 2.1 Difference Between Management and Administration

While management and administration are often used interchangeably, there are some differences:

| Basis | Management | Administration |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **Meaning** | Execution of policies and plans | Formulation of policies and plans |
| **Nature** | Executive function | Legislative function |
| **Level** | Middle and lower level | Top level |
| **Focus** | Managing people and work | Setting objectives and policies |
| **Decision Making** | Decisions within framework | Major policy decisions |
| **Skills Required** | Technical and human skills | Conceptual and human skills |
| **Example** | Department managers, supervisors | Board of Directors, CEO |
| **Scope** | Narrower (department level) | Wider (whole organization) |
| **Work** | Doing work | Thinking work |

**Simple Understanding:**
- **Administration** decides "what to do" and "when to do"
- **Management** decides "how to do" and "who will do"

**Example:**
- Administration decides: "We will expand our business to new cities"
- Management implements: "We will open 5 new branches, hire 50 employees, and allocate ₹1 crore budget"

## **3. Management: Art, Science, and Profession**

> PYQ: "Is management science, art and profession"? Justify your answer. (Jul-21, 15 marks)

### 3.1 Management as an Art

**Art** is the skillful and personal application of existing knowledge to achieve desired results. It requires practice, creativity, and personal skill.

**Management is an Art because:**

**1. Practical Knowledge:**
- Managers must apply management principles in real situations
- Theoretical knowledge alone is not sufficient
- Requires hands-on experience

**2. Personal Skill:**
- Different managers handle situations differently
- Success depends on individual creativity and judgment
- Each manager has their own style

**3. Creativity:**
- Managers must find innovative solutions to problems
- No two situations are exactly alike
- Requires imagination and originality

**4. Practice and Perfection:**
- Management skills improve with practice
- Experience makes managers more effective
- Learning by doing is essential

**5. Goal-Oriented:**
- Like art, management aims to achieve specific results
- Success is measured by outcomes
- Focuses on effectiveness

**Example:** Two managers with same knowledge may handle employee conflicts differently based on their personal skills and creativity.

### 3.2 Management as a Science

**Science** is a systematic body of knowledge based on cause-and-effect relationships, which can be verified through experiments.

**Management is a Science because:**

**1. Systematic Body of Knowledge:**
- Management has organized principles and theories
- Concepts like planning, organizing, controlling are well-defined
- Knowledge is accumulated over years of research

**2. Universal Principles:**
- Management principles apply to all organizations
- Principles like division of work, unity of command are universal
- Can be taught and learned

**3. Cause and Effect Relationship:**
- Management principles explain cause-and-effect
- Example: Good motivation leads to better performance
- Relationships can be established

**4. Experimentation and Observation:**
- Management principles are developed through observation
- Theories are tested in real situations
- Continuous research improves knowledge

**However, Management is NOT an Exact Science because:**
- Deals with human beings who are unpredictable
- Principles are flexible, not rigid like physics or chemistry
- Results cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy
- Social science, not pure science

### 3.3 Management as a Profession

**Profession** is an occupation requiring specialized knowledge, formal education, ethical code, and service motive.

**Management is becoming a Profession because:**

**1. Specialized Knowledge:**
- Management requires specialized education (MBA, BBA)
- Professional courses are available
- Continuous learning is necessary

**2. Formal Education:**
- Universities offer management degrees
- Professional training programs exist
- Certifications are available

**3. Professional Associations:**
- Organizations like All India Management Association (AIMA) exist
- Professional bodies promote management education
- Networking and knowledge sharing

**4. Ethical Code:**
- Managers are expected to follow ethical practices
- Professional conduct is important
- Social responsibility is emphasized

**5. Service Motive:**
- Managers serve organization and society
- Not just profit-driven
- Stakeholder welfare is important

**However, Management is NOT a Full Profession because:**
- No compulsory certification required to become manager
- No legal restrictions on entry
- No single professional body controls entry
- Anyone can become a manager without formal degree

**Conclusion:** Management is a combination of Art, Science, and Profession. It is an art because it requires personal skills, a science because it has systematic principles, and an emerging profession because it requires specialized knowledge and training.

## **5. Development of Management Thoughts**

> PYQ: Explain the evolution of management thoughts. (May-23, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: Explain system approach of Management. (Jul-22, 7.5 marks)

Management has evolved over time through contributions of various thinkers and practitioners. Different approaches have been developed to understand and practice management.

### 5.1 Classical Approach (1900-1930)

The classical approach focused on increasing efficiency and productivity. It has three main theories:

#### A. Scientific Management Theory (F.W. Taylor)

**Frederick Winslow Taylor** is known as the "Father of Scientific Management."

**Key Principles:**

**1. Science, Not Rule of Thumb:**
- Replace old traditional methods with scientific methods
- Study each task scientifically
- Find the best way to do each job

**2. Harmony, Not Discord:**
- Create cooperation between workers and management
- Avoid conflicts
- Both should work together for mutual benefit

**3. Cooperation, Not Individualism:**
- Workers and managers should cooperate
- Share responsibilities
- Work as a team

**4. Maximum Output:**
- Focus on increasing production
- Train workers for maximum efficiency
- Use scientific methods

**5. Development of Workers:**
- Select right person for right job
- Provide proper training
- Develop workers to their maximum potential

**Techniques of Scientific Management:**
- Time and motion study
- Standardization of tools and equipment
- Scientific selection and training
- Differential piece-rate system
- Functional foremanship

**Example:** Taylor studied how workers loaded pig iron and found that proper rest periods and scientific methods increased productivity from 12.5 tons to 47 tons per day per worker.

#### B. Administrative Management Theory (Henri Fayol)

**Henri Fayol** is known as the "Father of Modern Management."

Fayol identified **14 Principles of Management** (discussed in detail in next section) and **5 Functions of Management**:

**Five Functions of Management:**
1. **Planning**: Deciding in advance what to do
2. **Organizing**: Arranging resources
3. **Commanding**: Directing subordinates
4. **Coordinating**: Harmonizing activities
5. **Controlling**: Ensuring plans are followed

#### C. Bureaucratic Management Theory (Max Weber)

**Max Weber** proposed a formal system of organization based on rules and hierarchy.

**Key Features:**
- Clear hierarchy of authority
- Division of labor and specialization
- Written rules and regulations
- Impersonal relationships
- Career orientation
- Formal selection process

**Example:** Government organizations follow bureaucratic structure with clear rules, hierarchy, and procedures.

### 5.2 Human Relations Approach (1930-1950)

This approach emphasized the importance of human factors in management.

#### Hawthorne Studies (Elton Mayo)

**Key Findings:**
- Workers are not just economic beings
- Social and psychological factors affect productivity
- Informal groups influence behavior
- Participation and recognition motivate workers
- Good human relations improve productivity

**Example:** In Hawthorne experiments, productivity increased even when lighting was reduced because workers felt they were being given attention.

**Contributions:**
- Recognized importance of human element
- Emphasized social needs of workers
- Highlighted role of informal organization
- Showed importance of communication

### 5.3 Modern Approach (1950 onwards)

#### A. Systems Approach

> PYQ: Explain system approach of Management. (Jul-22, 7.5 marks)

**Systems Approach** views organization as a system composed of interrelated and interdependent parts.

**Key Concepts:**

**1. System:**
- A set of interrelated and interdependent parts
- Organization is a system with various subsystems
- All parts work together to achieve common goal

**2. Subsystems:**
- Production subsystem
- Marketing subsystem
- Finance subsystem
- Human resource subsystem
- All are interconnected

**3. Open System:**
- Organization interacts with environment
- Takes inputs from environment
- Gives outputs to environment
- Affected by external factors

**System Model:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT              │
│  ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │         ORGANIZATION (SYSTEM)         │  │
│  │                                       │  │
│  │  INPUT → PROCESS → OUTPUT             │  │
│  │    ↑                    ↓             │  │
│  │    └────── FEEDBACK ────┘             │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Components:**

**Input:**
- Raw materials
- Human resources
- Capital
- Information
- Technology

**Process (Transformation):**
- Planning
- Organizing
- Directing
- Controlling
- Converting inputs into outputs

**Output:**
- Products
- Services
- Profits
- Employee satisfaction
- Social contribution

**Feedback:**
- Information about output
- Helps in correcting process
- Continuous improvement

**Advantages:**
- Holistic view of organization
- Recognizes interdependence
- Emphasizes environment interaction
- Helps in coordination

**Example:** A manufacturing company takes raw materials (input), processes them through production (transformation), creates finished products (output), and uses sales data (feedback) to improve.

#### B. Contingency Approach

**Key Idea:** There is no one best way to manage. Management practices should vary according to the situation.

**Principles:**
- Management is situational
- Different situations require different approaches
- Manager must analyze situation and apply appropriate technique
- Flexibility is important

**Example:** Autocratic leadership may work in military but participative leadership works better in creative organizations.

## **6. Principles of Management**

> PYQ: Define Management. Also explain the characteristics and principles of Management. (Jul-22, 15 marks)

**Henri Fayol** gave **14 Principles of Management**. These are guidelines for managers to make decisions and take actions.

### 6.1 Fourteen Principles of Management

**1. Division of Work:**

Division of work means dividing the total work into small tasks and assigning each task to a specialist. This increases efficiency and expertise.

- Specialization improves skill
- Reduces time and effort
- Increases productivity
- Example: In a factory, one worker makes parts, another assembles, another packs

**2. Authority and Responsibility:**

Authority is the right to give orders and responsibility is the obligation to perform assigned tasks. Authority and responsibility must go together.

- Authority without responsibility leads to misuse
- Responsibility without authority leads to frustration
- Both should be balanced
- Example: A manager given responsibility to increase sales must have authority to hire salespeople

**3. Discipline:**

Discipline means obedience, respect for authority, and following rules and regulations. It is essential for smooth functioning.

- Clear rules should exist
- Rules should be fair
- Penalties for violation should be defined
- Example: Employees must come on time, follow dress code

**4. Unity of Command:**

Each employee should receive orders from only one superior. This avoids confusion and conflict.

- Prevents confusion
- Fixes responsibility
- Avoids conflicting instructions
- Example: A worker should report to only one supervisor, not multiple managers

**5. Unity of Direction:**

All activities with the same objective should be directed by one manager using one plan. This ensures coordination.

- One head, one plan for related activities
- Ensures unified effort
- Example: All marketing activities (advertising, sales, promotion) should be under one marketing manager

**6. Subordination of Individual Interest to General Interest:**

Organizational goals should take priority over individual goals. Personal interests should not come in the way of organizational interests.

- Organization's interest is supreme
- Personal goals should align with organizational goals
- Example: An employee should not leak company secrets for personal gain

**7. Remuneration:**

Employees should be paid fair wages for their work. Remuneration should satisfy both employees and employer.

- Should be fair and reasonable
- Should motivate employees
- Should be within organization's capacity
- Example: Competitive salary, bonuses, incentives

**8. Centralization and Decentralization:**

Centralization means concentration of authority at top level. Decentralization means distribution of authority to lower levels. Right balance is needed.

- Complete centralization or decentralization is not good
- Depends on size and nature of organization
- Example: Small business may be centralized, large corporation needs decentralization

**9. Scalar Chain:**

Scalar chain is the chain of superiors from highest to lowest level. Communication should follow this chain, but can be bypassed in emergency using "Gang Plank."

- Clear line of authority
- Communication flows through proper channel
- Gang Plank allows direct communication in urgent situations
- Example: Worker → Supervisor → Manager → General Manager → CEO

**10. Order:**

There should be a place for everything and everything should be in its place. This applies to both materials (Material Order) and people (Social Order).

- **Material Order**: Right material at right place
- **Social Order**: Right person at right job
- Reduces wastage and confusion
- Example: Tools arranged properly, employees assigned suitable positions

**11. Equity:**

Managers should be fair and kind to subordinates. There should be no discrimination.

- Fair treatment to all
- Creates loyalty and devotion
- Justice with kindness
- Example: No favoritism, equal opportunities for all

**12. Stability of Tenure:**

Employees should have job security. Frequent changes in personnel are not good for organization.

- High turnover is costly
- Employees need time to learn and settle
- Stability creates loyalty
- Example: Permanent employees perform better than those on temporary contracts

**13. Initiative:**

Employees should be encouraged to take initiative and suggest improvements. This increases motivation.

- Freedom to think and execute plans
- Encourages creativity
- Increases involvement
- Example: Suggestion box, employee participation in decision making

**14. Esprit de Corps:**

This means "team spirit." Management should promote unity and harmony among employees.

- Union is strength
- Avoid divide and rule
- Build team spirit
- Example: Team building activities, celebrating success together
