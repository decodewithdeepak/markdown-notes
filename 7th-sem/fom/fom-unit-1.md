## **1. Introduction to Management**

> PYQ: Define Management. Also explain the characteristics and principles of Management. (Jul-22, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: "Management is a continuous process." (Jul-22, 2.5 marks)

### 1.1 Meaning and Definitions

**Management** is the process of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling organizational resources to achieve goals efficiently and effectively. It means getting things done through people.

**Key Definitions:**

**Henri Fayol:** "To manage is to forecast and plan, to organize, to command, to coordinate and to control."

**F.W. Taylor:** "Management is the art of knowing what you want to do and then seeing that it is done in the best and cheapest way."

**Harold Koontz:** "Management is the art of getting things done through and with people in formally organized groups."

### 1.2 Characteristics of Management

**1. Goal-Oriented:** All activities directed towards achieving specific objectives

**2. Universal:** Needed in all organizations (business, government, hospitals, schools)

**3. Continuous Process:** Ongoing activity, never ends

**4. Multi-dimensional:**
- Management of Work (what to do)
- Management of People (who will do)
- Management of Operations (how to do)

**5. Group Activity:** Works through teams, coordinates individual efforts

**6. Dynamic:** Adapts to changing environment

**7. Intangible:** Cannot be seen, felt through results

**8. Composite Process:** Involves multiple interrelated functions

---

## **2. Management vs Administration**

> PYQ: Differentiate between Management and Administration. (Jul-22, 2.5 marks)

| Aspect | Management | Administration |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Nature** | Executive (execution) | Legislative (policy making) |
| **Level** | Middle and lower | Top level |
| **Focus** | Implementing plans | Formulating policies |
| **Decisions** | Within framework | Major policy decisions |
| **Example** | Department managers | Board of Directors, CEO |

**Simple:** Administration decides "what to do", Management decides "how to do"

---

## **3. Management: Art, Science, and Profession**

> PYQ: "Is management science, art and profession"? Justify your answer. (Jul-21, 15 marks)

### 3.1 Management as an Art

**Art** is skillful application of knowledge to achieve results.

**Management is Art because:**
- Requires practical knowledge and personal skill
- Different managers handle situations differently (creativity)
- Improves with practice and experience
- Goal-oriented like art

**Example:** Two managers with same knowledge may solve problems differently based on their skills.

### 3.2 Management as a Science

**Science** is systematic body of knowledge based on cause-effect relationships.

**Management is Science because:**
- Has organized principles and theories
- Universal principles (applicable everywhere)
- Based on observation and experimentation
- Cause-effect relationships exist

**However, NOT an Exact Science:**
- Deals with unpredictable humans
- Principles are flexible, not rigid
- Results cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy

### 3.3 Management as a Profession

**Profession** requires specialized knowledge, formal education, and ethical code.

**Management is Emerging Profession because:**
- Requires specialized education (MBA, BBA)
- Professional associations exist (AIMA)
- Ethical code followed
- Service motive present

**However, NOT a Full Profession:**
- No compulsory certification required
- No legal restrictions on entry
- Anyone can become manager without formal degree

**Conclusion:** Management is a blend of Art, Science, and Emerging Profession.

## **5. Development of Management Thoughts**

> PYQ: Explain the evolution of management thoughts. (May-23, 15 marks)  
> PYQ: Explain system approach of Management. (Jul-22, 7.5 marks)

### 5.1 Classical Approach (1900-1930)

#### A. Scientific Management (F.W. Taylor)

**Key Principles:**
1. **Science, Not Rule of Thumb:** Scientific methods instead of traditional
2. **Harmony, Not Discord:** Cooperation between workers and management
3. **Cooperation, Not Individualism:** Teamwork
4. **Maximum Output:** Increase productivity
5. **Development of Workers:** Training and development

**Techniques:** Time-motion study, standardization, differential piece-rate

**Example:** Taylor increased productivity from 12.5 to 47 tons per worker per day through scientific methods.

#### B. Administrative Management (Henri Fayol)

**Father of Modern Management**

**Five Functions:** Planning, Organizing, Commanding, Coordinating, Controlling

**14 Principles:** (discussed in next section)

#### C. Bureaucratic Management (Max Weber)

**Features:** Clear hierarchy, division of labor, written rules, impersonal relationships, career orientation

**Example:** Government organizations follow bureaucratic structure.

### 5.2 Human Relations Approach (1930-1950)

**Elton Mayo - Hawthorne Studies**

**Key Findings:**
- Workers are not just economic beings
- Social and psychological factors affect productivity
- Informal groups influence behavior
- Recognition and participation motivate workers

**Example:** Productivity increased even when lighting reduced because workers felt valued.

### 5.3 Modern Approach (1950 onwards)

#### Systems Approach

> PYQ: Explain system approach of Management. (Jul-22, 7.5 marks)

**Systems Approach** views organization as a system of interrelated parts interacting with environment.

**Components:**

```
ENVIRONMENT
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  INPUT → PROCESS → OUTPUT       │
│    ↑                  ↓         │
│    └──── FEEDBACK ────┘         │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Input:** Raw materials, human resources, capital, information

**Process:** Planning, organizing, directing, controlling (transformation)

**Output:** Products, services, profits, satisfaction

**Feedback:** Information about output used to improve process

**Key Points:**
- Organization is open system (interacts with environment)
- All parts are interdependent
- Holistic view of organization

**Example:** Manufacturing company takes raw materials (input), processes them (transformation), creates products (output), uses sales data (feedback) to improve.

#### Contingency Approach

**Key Idea:** No one best way to manage. Management depends on situation.

**Example:** Autocratic leadership works in military, participative leadership in creative firms.
