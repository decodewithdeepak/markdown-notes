## MODE OF CONDUCT
- Lecture hours are to be used for lecture/practice sessions.
- Lectures hours are to be used for interactive discussion, placing the proposals about the topics at hand and motivating students to reflect, explore and verify them.
- Practice hours are to be used for practice sessions.
- While analysing and discussing the topic, the faculty mentor's role is in pointing to essential elements to help in sorting them out from the surface elements. In other words, help the students explore the important or critical elements.
- In the discussions, particularly during practice sessions, the mentor encourages the student to connect with one's own self and do self-observation, self-reflection and self-exploration. Scenarios may be used to initiate discussion. The student is encouraged to take up "ordinary" situations rather than "extra-ordinary" situations. Such observations and their analyses are shared and discussed with other students and faculty mentor, in a group sitting.
- Practice experiments are important for the course. The difference is that the laboratory is everyday life, and practical are how you behave and work in real life. Depending on the nature of topics, worksheets, home assignment and/or activity are included. The practice sessions would also provide support to a student in performing actions commensurate to his/her beliefs. It is intended that this would lead to development of commitment, namely behaving and working based on basic human values.
- It is recommended that this content be placed before the student as it is, in the form of a basic foundation course, without including anything else or excluding any part of this content. Additional content may be offered in separate, higher courses.
- This course is to be taught by faculty from every teaching department, including HSS faculty. Teacher preparation with a minimum exposure to at least one 8-day FDP on Universal Human Values is deemed essential.

## ASSESSMENT
This is a compulsory credit course. The assessment is to provide a fair state of development of the student, so participation in classroom discussions, self-assessment, peer assessment etc. will be used in evaluation.
